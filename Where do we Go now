Verse:

walked (upon) a thousand miles away
let me star(t) let me start
far from where we are right now
let me start
let me start

we left in the morning
came back in the evening
(we) cried in the night when we fall asleep loving
(I) we got thousands people waiting for (my) our marriage
(I) we got (plenty of/thousand) people.. (their) life (is just another moment /will offer different moments) afterwards
I feel so tired


Chorus:

Where do we go now?
Far where we're coming from?
Where do we go now?
baby I'm so curious
Where do we go now?
far from where we are now?
Where do we go now? 
Baby I'm so curious

Bridge:
so curious
c, c, c so curious
Baby Im so curious

so so curious
so so so curious

Chorus:

Where do we go now?
Far where we're coming from?
Where do we go now?
baby I'm so curious
Where do we go now?
baby I do 
Where do we go now? Babe, Where do we go now?

so so so curious 
so so so curious
