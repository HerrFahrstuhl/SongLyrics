Verse:

woke up a thousand miles away
let me star let me start
far from where we are right now
let me start
let me start

we left in the morning
came back in the evening
we cried in the night while we fell asleep loving
we got thousand people waiting for our marriage
we got plenty people.. 
our life might loose its special moments afterwards
I feel so tired


Chorus:


Where do we go now?
Far where we're coming from?
Where do we go now?
far from where we are now?
Where do we go now? 
Baby I'm so curious


Verse 2:

Every time that you come back  
It’s like you’ve never been away
together we know how to make 
everyday always beautiful

always beautiful
always beautiful
Who knows
Who knows


Bridge:

There’s no need to know 
where we are heading 
if we are together
We’re already here 
so why can’t we just 
wait and let it happen?"
